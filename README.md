# 🚀 React Resume Website

This is a personal resume website built using **React.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It includes multiple sections such as About, Projects, Experience, Skills, and Contact, and uses modern React features like props, state, conditional rendering, and dynamic rendering via `.map()`.

## 🧠 Challenges Faced

- **Dark Mode Navigation Visibility**: Initially, the navigation bar wasn’t visible in dark mode. Resolved this by conditionally applying Tailwind classes for background and text color.

- **Responsive Sidebar**: Creating a sidebar that slides in and out with smooth transitions for small screens required managing state and CSS transitions effectively.

- **Skills Display**: Mapping grouped skill categories dynamically to cards for better readability.

- **Deployment**: Ensuring the Tailwind configuration and dark mode worked correctly on Vercel required proper setup of `tailwind.config.js` and Vite production build handling.
